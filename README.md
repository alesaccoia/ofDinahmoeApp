This is a relocatable directory structure that contains openframeworks projects for Mac,iOs,Android all sharing the same source code


By changing the content of 
   rootPath.configureMe
by pointing it to the correct location of openframeworks the xcode and android studio projects will open and work out of the box.

Mind that I am using the master branch of openframeworks
https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks
because it contains all the libraries for all platforms.
